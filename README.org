* Emacs configuration


- general-settings.el :: All settings in this file require no
     external dependencies.

- my-packages.el :: Contains some code to download packages I use
                    as well as configuration for those packages.

- old.el :: From my old .emacs file, just in case.


The .emacs.* files are symlinked or copied as ~/.emacs in their
respective locations.
